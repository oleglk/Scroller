Score-maker usage instructions

==== Score page scans preparation ==============================================
1.1) Scan the score pages as goos as possible.

1.2) Crop tightky on the sides.

1.3) Resize all page images to the same width
(recommended pixel-width:- ~80% of intended screen horizontal resolution)
 * set IMCONVERT {C:\Program Files\Imagemagick_711_3\convert.exe}
 * #### exec $IMCONVERT --version; check the path before script
 * file mkdir RESIZED
 * foreach f [glob {CROPPED/*.jpg}]  {$IMCONVERT $f -resize 800x -quality 92 [file join "RESIZED" [file tail $f]]}
 ****
 * !Having page-width close to screen resolution makes fading alerts visible!*/  

1.4) Mark all line top-s and last line bottom with the same color.
- use "Paint" application or alike; save results as .gif (or ppm, ?png?)
- place a small quadrant (5*5) of the chosen marker color in the top-left corner
- place the marks "tightly" close to the related score lines - as close as possible; just enough to include finger numbers (don't leave spare space beyound the upper/lower pixels of the most distant finger numbers in this line) 


==== Auto-generating score templates ===========================================
2.1) Put all page scans (with line markings) for the score into one directory and start Tcl/Tk graphical shell (usually "wish") in its parent directory.
TODO: symbolic link to "Code\" subdirectory
  >>>>> Example (Windows cmd):
  C:\Oleg\GitWork\Scroller\Scores\V02>md Scores
  C:\Oleg\GitWork\Scroller\Scores\V02>copy MARKED\Vals_by_Petrov__*.gif Scores\
  MARKED\Vals_by_Petrov__01.gif
  MARKED\Vals_by_Petrov__02.gif
  MARKED\Vals_by_Petrov__03.gif
          3 file(s) copied.

  C:\Oleg\GitWork\Scroller\Scores\V02>start C:\Oleg\Tools\TCL\freewrap_wish.exe
  C:\Oleg\GitWork\Scroller\Scores\V02>

2.2) (In Tcl shell) Load score-maker code
source C:/Oleg/GitWork/Scroller/Code/make_score.tcl

2.3) (In Tcl shell) Invoke the score-maker
make_score_file  "Vals_by_Petrov"  [list "Scores/Vals_by_Petrov__01.gif" "Scores/Vals_by_Petrov__02.gif" "Scores/Vals_by_Petrov__03.gif"]

>>>>>> Sample screen output:
  (V02) 3 % make_score_file  "Vals_by_Petrov"  [list "Scores/Vals_by_Petrov__01.gif" "Scores/Vals_by_Petrov__02.gif" "Scores/Vals_by_Petrov__03.gif"]
